= mangos v2

WARNING: This is a frozen repository, used to serve up the legacy v2 import path at nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2.
It should *not* be used except by old code still reliant on v2 import paths.  All new code should use
the import path "go.nanomsg.org/mangos/v3".  The main github.com/nanomsg/mangos repo is still current.

IMPORTANT: We strongly recommend users consider upgrading to go modules, and the new import path.

|===
|_Mangos&trade;_ v2  is an implementation in pure Go of the *SP*
("`Scalability Protocols`") messaging system.
These are colloquially  known as a "`nanomsg`".

|===

NOTE: This is version 2 of _mangos_, and contains breaking changes and
rather different API in some circumstances relative to version 1.  To use the
original version of _mangos_ please see https://github.com/nanomsg/mangos-v1

The modern C implementation of the SP protocols is available as
https://github.com/nanomsg/nng[__NNG&trade;__].

The original implementation of the SP protocols is available as
http://www.nanomsg.org[__nanomsg&trade;__].

Generally (modulo a few caveats) all of these implementations can inter-operate.

The design is intended to make it easy to add new transports with almost
trivial effort, as well as new topologies ("`protocols`" in SP parlance.)

At present, all of the Req/Rep, Pub/Sub, Pair, Bus, Push/Pull, and
Surveyor/Respondent patterns are supported.
This project also supports an experimental protocol called Star.

Supported transports include TCP, inproc, IPC, WebSocket, WebSocket/TLS and TLS.

Basic interoperability with nanomsg and NNG has been verified (you can do
so yourself with `nanocat` and `macat`) for all protocols and transports
that _NNG_ and _nanomsg_ support, except for the _ZeroTier_ transport and the PAIRv1
protocol, which are only supported in _NNG_ at this time.

There are a number of projects that use these products together.

// There is a third party experimental QUIC transport available at
// [quic-mangos](https://github.com/lthibault/quic-mangos).
// (An RFE to make this transport official exists.)

// If you find this useful, I would appreciate knowing about it.  I can be reached
// via my email address, garrett -at- damore -dot- org

== Documentation

For docs, see https://godoc.org/nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2 or run:

    $ godoc -http=:6060

then see http://localhost:6060/pkg/nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2/

== Testing

This package supports internal self tests, which can be run in
the idiomatic Go way.
(Note that most of the tests are in a test subdirectory.)

    $ go test nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2/...

There are also internal benchmarks available:

    $ go test -bench=. nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2/test

== Commercial Support

mailto:info@staysail.tech[Staysail Systems, Inc.] offers
http://staysail.tech/support/mangos[commercial support] for mangos.

== Examples

Some examples are posted in the directories under `examples/` in this project.

These examples are rewrites (in Go) of Tim Dysinger's
http://nanomsg.org/gettingstarted/index.html[Getting Started with Nanomsg].

Running `godoc` in the example directories will yield information about how
to run each example program.

Enjoy!
